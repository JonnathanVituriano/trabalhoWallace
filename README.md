An Assisgment of my university were we had to create an multiplayer game in C.
this is a game were that 2 into 4 players have to find what number is with the hints the program gives it's total of 4 hints. 
All the hints were made with maths solutions, so the player have to calculate the value of the number plus hint, so he can find easily the number that the program choosed.
